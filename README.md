# amazon_clone
This repository contains a front-end implementation of an Amazon clone, focusing on the user interface (UI) design and layout. 
The project aims to replicate the look and feel of the popular e-commerce platform using HTML and CSS only, without any JavaScript functionality.
I have made this project to gain and implement some basic HTML and CSS concepts. 
I will be updating it as I gain more knowledge about other web dev technologies and will update this repository as i gain more knowledge.
